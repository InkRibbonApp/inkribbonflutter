/// A basic text input field.
///
/// This widget interacts with the [TextInput] service to let the user edit the
/// text it contains. It also provides scrolling, selection, and cursor
/// movement. This widget does not provide any focus management (e.g.,
/// tap-to-focus).
///
/// ## Input Actions
///
/// A [TextInputAction] can be provided to customize the appearance of the
/// action button on the soft keyboard for Android and iOS. The default action
/// is [TextInputAction.done].
///
/// Many [TextInputAction]s are common between Android and iOS. However, if an
/// [inputAction] is provided that is not supported by the current
/// platform in debug mode, an error will be thrown when the corresponding
/// EditableTextV2 receives focus. For example, providing iOS's "emergencyCall"
/// action when running on an Android device will result in an error when in
/// debug mode. In release mode, incompatible [TextInputAction]s are replaced
/// either with "unspecified" on Android, or "default" on iOS. Appropriate
/// [inputAction]s can be chosen by checking the current platform and then
/// selecting the appropriate action.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// Upon completion of editing, like pressing the "done" button on the keyboard,
/// two actions take place:
///
///   1st: Editing is finalized. The default behavior of this step includes
///   an invocation of [onChanged]. That default behavior can be overridden.
///   See [onEditingComplete] for details.
///
///   2nd: [onSubmitted] is invoked with the user's input value.
///
/// [onSubmitted] can be used to manually move focus to another input widget
/// when a user finishes with the currently focused input widget.
///
/// Rather than using this widget directly, consider using [TextField], which
/// is a full-featured, material-design text input field with placeholder text,
/// labels, and [Form] integration.
///
/// ## Gesture Events Handling
///
/// This widget provides rudimentary, platform-agnostic gesture handling for
/// user actions such as tapping, long-pressing and scrolling when
/// [rendererIgnoresPointer] is false (false by default). To tightly conform
/// to the platform behavior with respect to input gestures in text fields, use
/// [TextField] or [CupertinoTextField]. For custom selection behavior, call
/// methods such as [RenderEditable.selectPosition],
/// [RenderEditable.selectWord], etc. programmatically.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [TextField], which is a full-featured, material-design text input field
///    with placeholder text, labels, and [Form] integration.
